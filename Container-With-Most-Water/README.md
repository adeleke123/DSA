## Container With Most Water

Given n non-negative integers a1, a2, â€¦, an, where each represents a point at coordinate (i, ai). n vertical lines are drawn such that the two endpoints of line i are at (i, ai) and (i, 0).

Find two lines, which, together with the x-axis forms a container, such that the container contains the most water.

Return the maximum amount of water a container can store.

Note: that you may not slant the container.

## Input Format

First Parameter - number `n`

Second Parameter - array arr of size `n`

## Output Format

Return the number.

## Example 1:

```
Input:
    9
    1 8 6 2 5 4 8 3 7
Output:
    49
Explanation:
    The above vertical lines are represented by array [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]. In this case, the max area of water (blue section) the container can contain is 49.
```
## Example 2:
```
Input:
    2
    1 1
Output:
    1
```

## Constraints:
+ 2 <= n <= 105
+ 0 <= arr[i] <= 104
+ Expected Space Complexity: O(n)
+ Expected Time Complexity: O(1)
